## Hey there 👋

I’m Pranjal, a **Senior Android Developer at KiarX**, working on scalable and reliable Android applications used in real-world, mission-critical environments.

I primarily work on Android development with a strong focus on performance, stability, and clean architecture. I’ve built and maintained production apps handling real-time data, camera-heavy features, and complex business logic.

Most of my work involves building systems from scratch, refactoring legacy codebases, and solving problems around memory management, multithreading, and long-running background tasks.
