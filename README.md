Hey there 👋

I’m Pranjal, a Senior Android Developer at KiarX, working on scalable and reliable Android applications used in real-world, mission-critical environments.

I primarily work on Android development with a strong focus on performance, stability, and clean architecture. I’ve built and maintained production apps handling real-time data, camera-heavy features, and complex business logic.

Most of my work involves building systems from scratch, refactoring legacy codebases, and solving problems around memory management, multithreading, and long-running background tasks.


🛠 Tools & Tech
• Android (Java, Kotlin, Android SDK)
• Firebase (Realtime DB, Auth, Storage, Crashlytics)
• Backend APIs (OkHttp, REST)
• ML Kit, TensorFlow Lite
• WebRTC, third-party SDKs
• Git, GitHub, Bitbucket
• Android Studio, Postman, VS Code


🚀 What I’ve Worked On
• Owned and managed 2 mission-critical Android apps used in daily operations
• Built real-time communication & camera features (walkie-talkie, video calls, CCTV streaming, 24/7 recording)
• Refactored single-Activity apps into modular, maintainable architectures
• Implemented controlled multithreading with ExecutorService & Futures
• Published 8+ Android apps on the Play Store (6 built from scratch)


📌 A Bit About Me
• I enjoy building systems that are stable, scalable, and production-ready
• Strong believer in clean code and long-term maintainability
• Always learning and improving as an engineer
